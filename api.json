      "full": "The Domovoi is a core figure in Russian and Slavic folklore, representing the protective spirit of the household. Traditionally depicted as a small old man with a long beard covered in hair, the Domovoi lives behind the stove or under the threshold and bonds with the family across generations. When properly respected through offerings and respectful speech, the Domovoi protects the home, helps with chores, warns of danger, and brings prosperity. However, if disrespected or forgotten, it can become mischievous or even harmful. The tradition includes specific rituals for inviting the Domovoi when moving to a new home to avoid bad luck."
